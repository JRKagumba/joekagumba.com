<div align="left">
Lately drivers have been losing some sleep.<br>
The cost of gas has been quite steep.<p>

As rising prices are in our forecast.<br>
I wanted to see how they were in the past.<p>

I explore some data from the 90s to now.<br>
To try to gain some insights somehow.<p>

I go through some plots that I created,<br>
A few of them even animated.<p>

Interested in the plots displayed?<br>
Click here to see how they were made.<p>

You’ve read my intro. I’ve planted the seed.<br>
Now let’s get started. Enjoy the read!<p>

The main purpose of this article is to go through different methods of exploring time series data. The actual analysis will be very informal. All fuel prices were retrieved from [Statistics Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1810000101). All monetary values are in Canadian dollars and have been adjusted to their present day (2022) dollar value.

Most plots were created using the [Plotly API](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/) . Plotly allows users to create dynamic interactive plots and I especially like their animation feature when exploring time series data (I was not paid to write that and I have no affiliation with plotly at all). For the most ideal view of the plots please click on the bolded link at the bottom left corner of each display.
