<p>Wisdom requires a flexible mind.<br>
How should we interpret the facts that we find?

<p>Adjusted understanding, for us to conform.<br>
Tribal truth is now the new norm.<p>

<p>Imposing opinions on our acts.<br>
Societal movements from shaky facts.<p>

<p>Regardless of what we choose to see.<br>
Essential we find a place to agree.<p>

<p>A question we must now define?<br>
Look at the first letter of every line.<p>
