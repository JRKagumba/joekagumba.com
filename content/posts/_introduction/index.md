Hi! I'm Joe, welcome to my blog. I'm an Ergonomic Engineer (currently working at Ford Motor Company) and all-around nerd. 

I started this blog for two purposes: to write about what I'm learning in my own words, and to share my perspectives and reflections with others and my future self. The former reason serves mainly to reinforce what I'm learning (you don't really know something unless you can teach it!), while the latter is simply a way for me to share what reflections I've found helpful for me and store a snapshot of my views over the course of my life. Many of the blog posts are a living document, so I'll come back and edit things, add new info, switch out the graphics, etc. These are also pretty informal posts, more of a quick brain dump than a work of literary art.

In all honesty, this is more of a journal than a blog, but I've chosen to make this journal public in the case of a) the content can help someone else and b) someone disagrees and we can have a discussion. I'm a big believer in open, frank critique of ideas and I believe the best way to grow an idea is to attack it. Don't take what I write on here for granted - ask yourself if what I'm talking about makes sense to you. If it doesn't, speak up! Let's have a discussion.

My posts are organized generally in to 4 sections as follows:

#### Academic Articles
  - Publications I've found interesting or brief articles about projects that I did while in school.

#### Ballads to Being
  - Some musings about life and general thoughts.

#### Pastime Projects
  - Writing about projects I'm working on or have worked on usually to try to build on a specific skill.

#### Study Sessions
  - General organized/unorganized notes about different topics I'm learning or have learned.
