<div align="left">
The following is a quick overview;<br>
Of a tiny project I wanted to do.<p>

Some plots and analysis done by me.<br>
Curiosity is the fuel that made them be.<p>

'96 was the data's publication premiere.<br>
Since then they've been published every year.<p>

I looked at some university employees,<br>
And some of their highest salaries.<p>

The following had no serious intent.<br>
Now, on to the project! Enjoy the content.<p>

In 1996 the Ontario government began publicly publishing salary information of all public sector emplyees who made over $100000 annually. The reasoning for publishing this information is to "ensure accountability to taxpayers".  The dataset is available [here](https://www.ontario.ca/public-sector-salary-disclosure/2021/all-sectors-and-seconded-employees/).
