# a summary about you
summary: "I am a passinate data science professinal and biomechanical engineer. Currently my interests surround computational modeling of human movements through computer vision or sensory interventions. 
I am also an Machine Learning Enthusiast, I often post about papers or projects I have found interesting on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-kagumba/)
or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JoeKagumba). When I am not working on projects, I am listening or reading about philosophy, going to comedy shows, doing something active or writing about my thoughts."


# 'I am a passionate software engineer with x years of working experience. 
# I built OSS tools for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) using GO. 
# My tools help people to deploy their workloads in Kubernetes. 
# Sometimes, I work on some fun projects such as writing a theme, etc.'

# "An organized, enthusiastic data science professional and technical engineer with a career devoted to finding solutions and process
# optimization. Strengths lie in working with decision-makers and multiple stakeholders from a variety of stakeholder groups to
# define problems, brainstorm possible solutions and establish consensus on the appropriate path forward. Demonstrate a unique
# balance of programmatic and process-oriented approaches to solve problems and drive greater performance. Currently seeking
# software engineering and data analyst opportunities in the tech start-up, e-commerce, or product marketing fields"

# "I am a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University in the Neuromuscular Biomechanics Laboratory, 
# where I also received my PhD in Bioengineering. I'm passionate about measuring and motivating movement
#  and increasing access to health care with digital technology. My research bridges the fields of biomechanics, 
#  psychology, and computer science to understand not just how we move, but how we think about movement 
#  and our motivation for being physically active. I value human-centered design and a holistic, 
#  lifestyle-focused approach to engineering and medicine. I enjoy cultivating creativity and humor in work 
#  and life, sharing ideas, and communicating science, particularly on my podcast, Biomechanics On Our Minds 
#  (my mom says it's her favorite biomechanics podcast)."

# "Calvin is broadly interested in sensing human motion and understanding how humans make sense of their own motion through a 
# combination of wearable technologies and stochastic modeling approaches."
